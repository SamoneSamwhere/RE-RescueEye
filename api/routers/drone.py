"""
Drone telemetry.

  GET  /drone/telemetry   where the aircraft is now
  POST /drone/telemetry   push a fix from any drone platform
  GET  /drone/sources     which telemetry paths are configured and live

The POST endpoint is what makes the platform drone-agnostic. No single
protocol reaches every aircraft — a Pixhawk speaks MAVLink, a DJI consumer
drone exposes nothing over its video link, a bespoke airframe may only manage
an HTTP request — so anything able to read a position can forward it here in
a few lines, in any language, without RescueEye needing to know the vendor.

MAVLink aircraft need no bridge at all: set MAVLINK_CONNECTION and the API
reads GLOBAL_POSITION_INT directly.
