"""
Drone feeds — MJPEG multipart streaming for up to four concurrent sources.

Each feed is an independent entry in `services.feed_registry` with its own
FFmpeg process and frame buffer, so adding an uploaded clip or a live RTSP URL
opens a new panel instead of replacing the one that was already running.

FFmpeg stores native-resolution frames; the MJPEG generator downscales for the
browser. The detection pipeline runs client-side — the browser grabs frames
from each panel and posts them to /detect — so per-feed inference needs nothing
extra here.

The legacy single-feed endpoints (/stream/feed3, /stream/status, /stream/source,
/stream/upload) are kept as aliases onto the primary (oldest) feed: the mobile
app's STREAM_URL and the existing docs still point at them.
