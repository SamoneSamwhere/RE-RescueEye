"""
Unit tests for the casualty gate.

The thing being pinned here is the distinction the system exists to make:
detectors find *people*, and only some people are casualties. Before this gate
existed every person box was relabelled "casualty", so a bystander or one of
our own rescuers raised VICTIM_DETECTED and queued for human review.

Each signal is tested in the regime where it is supposed to work, and — just
as importantly — in the regime where it is supposed to admit it cannot tell.
