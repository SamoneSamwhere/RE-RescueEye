"""
Shared pytest fixtures for the api/ test suite.

These env vars MUST be set before routers.detect is first imported by any
test module, since it reads them at import time to decide the confidence
thresholds for firing background tasks (incident creation + ntfy alert).
Setting them here (module scope, executed on conftest collection, which
always happens before test collection) neutralizes both so tests never
make real outbound network calls to ntfy.sh or a live Node server.

    Makes /detect return one body lying down, with the pose keypoints to prove

    The stub path inside _run_victim cannot stand in for this any more: without
    keypoints or a stillness window, box shape alone is not allowed to claim a
    casualty (a wide box is just as likely to be two people or a vehicle). Tests
