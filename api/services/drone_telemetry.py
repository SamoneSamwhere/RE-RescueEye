"""
Simulated drone flight telemetry.

The platform flies a single feed drone. Until real GPS hardware is integrated,
its position is simulated here — but *coherently*, which the previous approach
was not: `random_coord()` was called once per detection, so two casualties
spotted in the same video frame were reported kilometres apart, and the drone
had no continuous position anything could plot.

This module models one drone flying a smooth wandering track inside the Cebu
City area of interest. Position advances with real elapsed time, so the marker
on the commander's map moves at a plausible speed, and every detection in a
given frame shares the drone's single position at that instant — which is the
physical truth being modelled: the casualty is on the ground below the drone.

Replacing this with real telemetry means swapping `current_position()` for a
read of the flight controller's GPS feed; nothing else needs to change.
