Multi-feed registry.

The platform originally carried a single drone feed held in module-level
globals, where uploading a video or setting a live URL *replaced* it. An
operator watching one aircraft is not a command centre, so feeds are now
independent entries in a registry: each owns its own FFmpeg process, frame
buffer and lock, and can be added or removed without disturbing the others.

Capped at MAX_FEEDS because each feed is a live FFmpeg transcode plus a
detection loop in the browser — beyond four, a laptop running YOLO alongside
them starts dropping frames, which is worse than refusing the fifth.
