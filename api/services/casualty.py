"""
Casualty discrimination - deciding which detected *people* are casualties.

Both detectors in this system find people, not casualties. victim_best.onnx
declares exactly one class, "person", and the COCO assist pass is filtered to
COCO class 0. Until this module existed, routers/detect.py simply relabelled
every person box "casualty", so a bystander, a rescuer, or a crowd on a rooftop
all raised VICTIM_DETECTED and landed in the Command Staff review queue.

Nothing here detects anything. It takes person boxes and decides which of them
show evidence of being a casualty, using three signals that fail in different
conditions:

  posture    Prone, supine and collapsed bodies sit differently in frame from
             people on their feet. How that difference is measured depends on
             where the camera points: torso angle under an oblique camera,
             torso-to-shoulder foreshortening straight down. Using the angle at
             nadir is not merely weak, it inverts - a body lying on the ground
             projects along the image exactly as a standing body does from the
             side. See posture_from_keypoints.

  stillness  A casualty does not move. Measured per SORT track over a time
             window, with camera motion removed (services/egomotion.py);
             without that compensation a motionless body drifts across the
             frame at exactly the speed of the drone. Strongest from a stable
             overhead hover - precisely where posture is weakest.

  responder  A person standing where one of our own responders reported their
             position is that responder. A hard veto, never a score.

The two vision signals are complementary by construction, which is why they
are fused rather than chained: whichever one the current camera geometry
undermines, the other is in its best regime.
